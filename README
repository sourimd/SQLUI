The pupose of this project is to let users create SQL statements through Graphical User Interface
and display the results of the same. I did this project as part of my Database Management Systems
Design course at Clemson University.

At the backend I have used Northwind Database. The schema for that database has been encoded 
into metadata. Whenever user selects more than one table, this metadata will be used to
determine the relation between a pair of tables and the application will output a SQL statement
accordingly.

I have used JavaScript DOM Scripting, PHP, MySQL for writing this application.

A working demo of this app can be found at http://people.cs.clemson.edu/~sourimd/CPSC862/Ass7/

PS- On the LHS under Datasets column you will find a list of table names. Those names are
clickable. Once you click on them attributes of that table will appear in the next column.
